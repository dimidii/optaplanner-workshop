     * This class should have the following variables: id(long), subject(string), teacher(string), studentGroup(string), timeslot(Timeslot) and room(Room)
     * Tip: make all the variables private and provide getters.
     * Multiple constructors: one empty, two with all variables, one without id and one with id
     *
     * Extra tip: you can create your own toString that will help during debugging
